# 👋 Hi, I’m @ilaNihas
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## About Me
👀 I'm a big football fan (soccer for some), with a passion for technology. After spending 13 years in the IT industry, I've taken a break to immerse myself in the dynamic world of crypto, blockchain, and Web3.
🌱 I’m currently on a journey of discovery, learning all about the latest in blockchain technology. I’m fascinated by its potential and am always on the lookout for intriguing projects, airdrops, and new nodes to explore.
💞️ Combining my love for sports, writing, and technology, I'm excited to collaborate on projects that bridge these worlds. I'm keen to connect with like-minded individuals and teams who are as passionate about these areas as I am.
